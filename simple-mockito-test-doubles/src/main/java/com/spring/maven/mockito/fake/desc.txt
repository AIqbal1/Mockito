A fake object is a test double with real logic (unlike stubs) and is much more
simplified or cheaper in some way. Fake objects are working implementations. Mostly, the fake class extends the original
class, but it usually performs hacking, which makes it unsuitable for production.

examples:

The real object cannot be instantiated, such as when the constructor reads a
file, performs a JNDI lookup, and so on.

The real object has slow methods; for example, a class might have a
calculate () method that needs to be unit tested, but the calculate()
method calls a load ()method to retrieve data from the database. The
load() method needs a real database, and it takes time to retrieve data, so
we need to bypass the load() method to unit test the calculate behavior.
